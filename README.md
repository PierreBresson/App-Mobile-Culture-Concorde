# Culture Concorde

This is the mobile version of Culture Concorde, a free music player, crafted in a minimalist design. There is also a [macOS app](https://github.com/PierreBresson/App-MacOS-Culture-Concorde) and here is Culture Concorde [website](http://cultureconcorde.com/).

The app is based on ionic 2, written in typescript and will be available for iPhone and Android.

### Features

CC retrieves some playlists from soundcloud and plays randomly a song. You can share the song on Twitter or Facebook and jump to soundcloud.

### Caution

CC is not stable at all at the moment. WIP :)

### To do list

 * Improve performance
 * Android look
 * Reduce artwork size when phone screen is not 16:9
 * ...


### Build the app

Install ionic cli.

Install node_modules with ```npm i```

Put your soundcloud client ID ```"?client_id=HERE"``` in every category.

Type ```ionic serve``` and enjoy!
